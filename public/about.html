<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr/>
<p>My name is Jorge Panozo Kim, I'm 29 years old, I'm half bolivian, half Korean.
  I have a bachelor's degree in marketing but I also studied System engineering for 4 years before switching to marketing.
  I've also been the local president of an international organization, which is basically a company run just by young people 
  that develops leadership capabilities in other young people through volunteering work and internships in other countries.

  I have experience in marketing positions but lately I've been looking to transition my career to Web Development as I 
  believe there are better opportunities in the Tech world. Right now my goal is to become a full stack web developer and
  to find a remote job in a US based company. So I'm currently taking courses for web develpment languages, but also in 
  Phyton and SQL to be more versitile.
